# Persistent Bottom Navigation Bar

The code represents an example of a persistent bottom navigation bar without any external packages e.g. go_router. This bottom navigation was persisted using Flutter's own Navigator class. It also supports pushing context when tabs are switched and coming back to home when context is popped. 

The benefit is that you can use your navigator key along with persisting the bottom navigation bar which you cannot use otherwise while using go_router etc.
